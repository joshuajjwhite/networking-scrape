# networking-scrape

I needed some data scraped for some networking purposes. Utilizing a web scraping plugin and some pandas/python 
work I have scraped and cleaned the data into somthing usable for my purposes.

# Files in this Repo
- `*-clean.csv` files are the after product of cleaning a corresponding raw data file scraped from a website.
- `clean-*.py` are python scripts for cleaning corresponding raw data files
- Any other `.csv` file is a raw data file from the scraper.

# Technology used
- [web scraper plugin](https://www.webscraper.io)
- `python` and `pandas` for data cleaning
